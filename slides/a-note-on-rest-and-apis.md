##  A note on REST and APIs

- Restangular is really nice
- Build your grails urls w/ versioning in mind
- Think beyond domain-models to minimize requests

note:
    We had a tough time doing API design, its still a bit sloppy

    One case where giving some forethought may reduce a lot of churn time
