##  The Power of Angular

- Changes in JS Objects immediately reflected
- No special models necessary
- Little need to touch DOM directly
- DSL / Web Components that are Directives
- Excellent REST/JSON utilization

note:
    Big thing over other similar frameworks are
    Similarity to grails in MVC-ness
    Plain ol' JS objects
    Easy two-way binding
