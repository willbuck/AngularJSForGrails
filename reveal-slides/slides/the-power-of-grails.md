##  Why Grails?

- Familiar tool chains for development and deployment
- Dead simple database integrations, SQL & NoSQL
- Recognition of rapidly growing front-end ecosystem
- Powerful new REST support

note:
    Most of you are probably quite familiar with
    Grails so I won't dwell on it
    But worth noting that the Grails team recognizes
    uses beyond a simple crud app
    Changes are taking place to support API server designs
    Good JSON support back through 1.3 though
